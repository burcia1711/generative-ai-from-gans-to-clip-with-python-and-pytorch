## ðŸŽ“ Learning Generative AI from GANs to CLIP with Python and PyTorch

I'm currently learning how to implement a basic GAN architecture from scratch. This repository follows along with a hands-on coding course that walks through each essential component of GANs. Here's the current progress of my learning journey:

### âœ… completed modules
#### coding a basic generative architecture 
1. **importing libraries & visualisation**
   - set up the environment and created a utility function for visualising generated images.
2. **hyperparameters & DataLoader**
   - defined training parameters and created a data loader to feed the model's images.
3. **generator class**
   - built the generator neural network responsible for producing fake images.
4. **discriminator class**
   - implemented the discriminator network that distinguishes real images from fake ones.
5. **optimiser setup & generator testing**
   - configured the optimisers and performed initial tests on the generator output.
6. **loss functions**
   - calculate and track losses for both the generator and discriminator.
7. **training loop (discriminator)**
   - begin training the discriminator in a loop using real and generated data.
8. **training loop (generator & stats)**
   - train the generator and log relevant performance statistics.
9. **final training run**
   - run the full training loop and observe GAN performance over epochs.

### ðŸ”œ upcoming modules
#### coding an advanced generative architecture 
#### generating images from text by combining two advanced architectures
#### editing people's clothes by combining segmentation and generative AI models
#### and more hopefully!
