## ðŸŽ“ Learning Generative AI from GANs to CLIP with Python and PyTorch

I'm currently learning how to implement a basic GAN architecture from scratch. This repository follows along with a hands-on coding course that walks through each essential component of GANs. Here's the current progress of my learning journey:

### âœ… Completed Modules

1. **Importing Libraries & Visualization**
   - Set up the environment and created a utility function for visualising generated images.

2. **Hyperparameters & DataLoader**
   - Defined training parameters and created a data loader for feeding images to the model.

3. **Generator Class**
   - Built the generator neural network responsible for producing fake images.

4. **Discriminator Class**
   - Implemented the discriminator network that distinguishes real images from fake ones.

5. **Optimizer Setup & Generator Testing**
   - Configured the optimisers and performed initial tests on the generator output.

### ðŸ”œ Upcoming Modules

6. **Loss Functions**
   - Calculate and track losses for both the generator and discriminator.

7. **Training Loop (Discriminator)**
   - Begin training the discriminator in a loop using real and generated data.

8. **Training Loop (Generator & Stats)**
   - Train the generator and log relevant performance statistics.

9. **Final Training Run**
   - Run the full training loop and observe GAN performance over epochs.
